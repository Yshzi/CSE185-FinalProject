# Benchmarking
Multiple Sequence Alignement was inspired by MAFFT and so we will be benchmarking using MAAFT. In this directory, you will find a benchmarking fasta file that contains three protein sequences that can be used as input for benchmarking. Additionally we have included the Multiple Sequence Alignment python code so the code can be run in the same directory as the files.

## Installing MAAFT
First, we have to install MAAFT. To install MAFFT follow the instructions on this [website](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/). Ensure that you are using the correct download instructions for your operating system.

### Windows
For windows we downloaded the `All-In-One version`. After downloading the .zip file. We extracted its contents per the instructions from the MAAFT website. Then we opened the terminal with powershell, and changed the directory until we were in the `mafft-win` folder. After, we ran MAAFT on the `benchmark.fasta` file by using 
```
Measure-Command {.\mafft.bat <filepath to benchmark.fasta> --ep 0 --op 0}
``` 
The command `Measure-Command` is a cmdlet for powershell that allows us to see how long it take to execute the code in the curly brackets.

### MacOS
For Mac we downloaded the `Standard package`. After downloading and following the installation instructions. Then we opened the terminal and ran 
```
time /usr/local/bin/mafft <filepath to benchmark.fasta>
```
`time` is command-line utility that allows us to see how long it takes to execute the code. 

## Benchmarking MSA.py
Now we will benchmark MSA.py. Using the timing tool for your specific operating system as specified as above we will look at the runtimes for MSA.py. To reiterate, windows will use `Measure-Command` and mac will use `time`. Ensure that you are in the benchmarking directory in this repository. Windows users will use 
```
Measure-Command {python3 MSA.py benchmark.fasta}
```
and mac users will use
```
time python3 MSA.py benchmark.fasta
```
The output should be the time it took for the code to run. Now we have both the benchmark times for MAAFT and MSA that we can now compare.
