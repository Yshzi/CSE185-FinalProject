## Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) tool
### Overview 
This respository provides tools and resources for performing Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), a fundamental task in bioinformatics and computational biology. MSA allows user to align and identify similarities and differences among multiple biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. 

### Installation (NOT SURE ABOUT THIS PART)
To use the MSA tools provided in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
'git clone .....'
2. Set up the environment:
'mkdir msa 
cd msa'
3. Run the setup script: 
'python MSA.py input.fasta'

### Usage 
The MSA tools can be used to align up to three sequences. Provide the input sequences in suported format and run the alignment command. Here's an example:
'python MSA.py input.fasta'
Replace 'input.fasta' file with the path to your input FASTA format file.
