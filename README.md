# Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) Tool (CSE 185 Final Project)
### Overview 
This respository provides tools and resources for performing Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), a fundamental task in bioinformatics and computational biology. MSA allows user to align and identify similarities and differences among multiple biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. 

### Installation 
To use the MSA tools provided in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Yshzi/CSE185-FinalProject.git`

2. Set up the environment:
```
cd CSE185-FinalProject
```
3. Run the setup script: 

`python MSA.py input.fasta`

### Usage 
The MSA tools can be used to align up to three sequences. Provide the input sequences in suported format and run the alignment command. 

Here's an example:

`python MSA.py input.fasta`

Replace `input.fasta` file with the path to your input FASTA format file. 

### Basic Usage:
The basic usage of `MSA` is:
`python MSA.py input.fasta`
To run `MSA` on a small test example (using files in this repo):
`python MSA.py test.fasta`
# File Format
The output file format is...
